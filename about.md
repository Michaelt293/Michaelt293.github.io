I am a Scala/Haskell programmer working in the area of Big Data. I have a passion for functional programming and enjoy writing clear/concise code.

My background is in chemistry/mass spectrometry. Notably, I was involved in the development of the analytical technique Ozone-Induced Dissociation (OzID) during my PhD studies. This technique allows double bond positions within lipids to be rapidly identified by mass spectrometry.

Outside of programming and science, I enjoy language learning (Mandarin), travel, severe weather, photography and strength training.
